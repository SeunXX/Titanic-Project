GOAL
The goal is to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. 
For each PassengerId in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the Survived variable.


COMPETITION DESCRIPTION
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

It was later observed that those that survived the shipwreck attributed their survival to several elements: mother nature luck, sex of the survivor, age- children were given priviledge, and the cabin class you booked during the voyage. 

In this challenge, the task is to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, applying the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.
